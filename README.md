<!-- PROBLEMATICS -->
## Problematics

When I began learning English, I discovered an incredibly helpful video playlist. To practice translating and composing sentences, I initially used a standard Word document. This method quickly proved to be inconvenient and inefficient, lacking both structure and accessibility.

Driven by the desire for a better learning experience, I decided to create my own website. Now, language study is not only productive, but also enjoyable. All my progress is securely stored in a database, allowing me to seamlessly continue learning from any device, without being tied to a specific computer or document. This platform has transformed my language journey, making practice easy, engaging, and always accessible.

### TL;DR

I found a useful playlist for practicing English, but using Word was inconvenient. So I created this website â€” now my progress is saved online and learning is much easier and more enjoyable.
